**gradSim** is a unified differentiable rendering and multiphysics framework that allows solving a range of control and parameter estimation tasks (rigid bodies, deformable solids, and cloth) directly from images/video. Our unified computation graph — spanning from the dynamics and through the rendering process — enables learning in challenging visuomotor control tasks, without relying on state-based (3D) supervision, while obtaining performance competitive to or better than techniques that rely on precise 3D labels.
